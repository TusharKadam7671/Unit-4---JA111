Q.)Explain AutoBoxing and Auto UnBoxing with Examples.

Answer-

The automatic conversion of primitive data types into its equivalent Wrapper
type is known as boxing and opposite operation is known as unboxing. This is 
the new feature of Java5. So java programmer doesn't need to write the
conversion code.

Advantage of Autoboxing and unboxing-
	No need of conversion between primitives and wrappers manually so less
coding is required.

Example of Autoboxing-

class Main{

	public static void main(String args[]){
	
	int a=50;
	
	Integer i1 = new Integer(a);  //Boxing
	
	Integer i2 = 5; //Boxing;
	
	System.out.println(i1+i2);
	
	}

}


Example of Unboxing -

The automatic conversion of wrapper class type into corresponding primitive
type, is known as Unboxing.

class Main{

	public static void main(String args[]){
	
	Integer i = new Integer(50);
	
	int a = i;
	
	System.out.println(a);
	
	}

}
