Q.Explain about hashCode and equals method.
Answer-

equals() method-
1.equals method belongs to java.lang.object class.
2.this method is used to compare to objects
3.this method return boolean value if both objects are same then it
will return as true else false.
4.but for objects to be same, they should have same memory location so we have to
override this equals method and the other method is hashCode();
5.syntax-
	public boolean equals(Object obj);
	
hashCode() method-
1.To be same for objects they should override equals method and at a same time
should override this hashcode method also
2.there is a contract between equal and hashcode method- if any objects are same
by equals method then they should same by hashcode method also.
3.so we have to override these two methods at a same time.
4.hashcode method returns integer value
5.syntx-
	public int hashCode();
	
	
	
if equals method return false then hashcode method also return different values and
if equals method return true then hashcode method return same hashcode int value.This
is known as their contract.
