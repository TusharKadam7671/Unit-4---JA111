Q1) Explain why Java is platform independent ?

Ans.)

1.Java is platform independent is because of 'byte code'.
2.In java program we can write or compile on one operating system and can execute that code on 
	another operating system i.e. 'WORA' - write ones and run anywhere
3.While writing java code and after compiling it converts into byte code.
4.'JVM' is responsible for executing that byte code and JVM is platform independent
5.JVM provides runtime environment to execute the byte code and
	that byte code is converted into 'machine specific code'.
6.because of the WORA, JVM's platform independence, 'JAVA is platform independent'.
