Q4) Explain why the following block of code will give a compile time error?
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {

	float f=3.3;
	System.out.println(f);
	}
}



Ans)

--In java, we have float and double as floating point literals, 
  where double is the default data type of floating point literals and not the float. 
  This is the reason why java is telling that possible lossy conversion from double to float.
--And reason for lossy conversion is because, double is bigger than float. 
  When you try to fit-in the bigger one into the smaller one, you will get this error.
  

  
--Possible conversion
  1)float f=(float)3.3;
  2)float f=3.3f;
  
#code-

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {

	float f=(float)3.3;
	//or   float f=3.3f;

	System.out.println(f);
	
	}
}
