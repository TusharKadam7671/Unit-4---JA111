Q3) How does java achieve platform independency?

Ans-
Platform Independent means “write once and run anywhere”. Here in the programming, writing means compiling. 
	Platform Independent means writing a piece of code on one operating system and that complied code is able to run on another operating system. 
	Java is Platform Independent because of its Byte Code. 
	When we write or (compile) the java code, it gets converted to Byte Code which can run on all operating systems requires JVM (Java Virtual Machine). 
	JVM is also known as Interpreter which comes along JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Run time Environment). 
	JVM converts the ByteCode to the Machine Specific Code
