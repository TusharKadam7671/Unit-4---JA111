Non-static variable-
1. Non-static variable also known as instance variable because memory is allocated whenever is created
2. Non-static variables are specific to an object
3. Non-static variable can access with an object reference.
4. syntax- Obj_ref.variable_name
5. These variables should not be preceded by any static keyword. Example:
class A
{
int a;
}
6. Memory is allocated for these variables whenever an object is created.
7. Memory is allocated multiple times whenever a new object is created.


 



Static variable-
1. Memory is allocated at the time of loading of class so that these are also known as class variables.
2. static variable are common for every object which means these memory locations can be shareable by every object reference or same class.
3. Static variable can access with class reference.
4. syntax- class_name.variable_name
5. These variables are preceded by static keyword. Example:
class A
{
static int b;
}
6. Memory is allocated for these variables at the time of loading of the class.
7. Memory is allocated for these variables only once in the program
