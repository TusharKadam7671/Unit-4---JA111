Q1) a) Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write
some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

b) What is the difference between equals method and == operator in java? And what will be the output of the
following code snippets and giving proper explanation.

Code snippet 1 >
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));

Code snippet 2 >
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("abc");
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("abc");
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));
Code snippet 3 >

String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String("abc");
System.out.println(s1==s2);


Answer-->

a)

1.String is immutable in java because of security purpose. We create strings of username and password,
 ans many other important information so it is necessary to make strings immutable.
2.In java, there is multithreading thats why strings should be immutable.
3.When we create strings that will be created in string pool area and instead of heap area we use that
 so it is memory saving.
4.And we can use that string from string pool area multi time by assigning a new variable,
		these are the reasons for immutability of the string.
		
		
b)

Basically equals method compares values and == operator goes for address comparison

code snippet 1-
	this gives output as "true" because equals method will check the values of s1 and s2,
and that are same "abc" so the result is true.

code snippet 2-
	this gives output as "false" because even the values are same but the address of the
strings sb1 and sb2 are different and both are mutable so the comparison should be false.

code snipet 3-
	this gives output as "false" because the strings having different address in the
heap area.
