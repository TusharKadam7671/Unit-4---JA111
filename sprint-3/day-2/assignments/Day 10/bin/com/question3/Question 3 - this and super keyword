Q3) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Answer-

				'this'

1.The this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object. 
There are the various uses of this keyword in Java. It can be used to refer to current class properties 
such as instance methods, variable, constructors, etc. It can also be passed as an argument into 
the methods or constructors. It can also be returned from the method as the current class instance.


2.There are the following uses of this keyword.
	-this can be used to refer to the current class instance variable.
	-this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
	-this() can be used to invoke the current class constructor.
	-this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
	-this can be passed as an argument in the constructor call.
	-this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.

				'super'
				
1.The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. 
Whenever you create the instance of the subclass, an instance of the parent class is created implicitly 
which is referred by super reference variable. The super() is called in the class constructor implicitly 
by the compiler if there is no super or this.


2.There are the following uses of super keyword.

	-super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
	-super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
	-super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are the following differences between this and super keyword.

1.The super keyword always points to the parent class contexts whereas 
this keyword always points to the current class context.

2.The super keyword is primarily used for initializing the base class variables within the derived class constructor whereas 
this keyword primarily used to differentiate between local and instance variables when passed in the class constructor.

3.The super and this must be the first statement inside constructor otherwise the compiler will throw an error.
